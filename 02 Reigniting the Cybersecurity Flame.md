# Reigniting the Cybersecurity Flame - A Personal Reflection

## Why It Started

For a long time, cybersecurity lived in the back of my mind - something I always intended to return to once the timing was right. The truth is, the timing never felt right. I finished my degree and told myself I'd jump in with both feet, but life had other plans.

And then the moment came when my hand was forced. A few weeks ago, the company I’ve worked at for years announced that a large portion of the business would be shutting down, and the rest would be sold. Initially, I was told I would be laid off by the end of the year. That punched a hole straight through the illusion of stability I’d been living in. Management eventually made moves that secured me a position through the handover, which was a relief - but also a massive wake‑up call.

It lit a fire that needed to be lit.

## Why It Didn’t Start Earlier

This part is deeply personal.

When I started my degree, the plan was simple: finish school, go into cybersecurity. But while I was finishing that degree, I stepped into a reliability analyst role - a job far more challenging and fulfilling than anything I’d had before. It paid extremely well too. The kind of pay that makes you feel like you’d be an idiot to walk away. **Golden handcuffs** - I didn’t fully understand the term until I was wearing them.

Then came the timing. I finished school during the winter of 2020 - peak lockdown. My industry never slowed down. In fact, the workload grew. I was juggling on‑site responsibilities, remote analysis, and the most difficult period of my personal life. A close family member, in failing health, lived with us and needed constant care. My wife - a literal angel - shouldered most of it, but it was still a shared responsibility.

And then 2021 hit like a hammer. I lost two people I loved dearly. The emotional aftermath left me exhausted in a way that took years to articulate. I didn’t have the energy to reinvent my life. I just needed to survive long enough to recalibrate.

Cybersecurity had to wait.

## Searching for Direction

Cybersecurity is not one field - it’s thousands. For someone who thrives by focusing deeply on singular mastery, the lack of direction is paralyzing. Bruce Lee said, *“I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.”* That philosophy has carried me through everything - music, martial arts, engineering, daily discipline.

But cybersecurity? It feels like 27 million kicks. All of them important. All of them different. Fragmented. Overwhelming.

Not knowing where to focus was the most discouraging part.

## What I Remembered

A few months ago, I decided to dip my toe back in. I expected to discover that I had forgotten everything - that the years away had left me empty‑handed. Before even revisiting the material, I took some SecurityX pretests… and I did well. Better than expected.

That moment anchored something: my mind for security is still intact - because it’s the same muscle I use in reliability. Root‑cause analysis is detective work. System interactions. Failure modes. Patterns. It’s the same game, different domain.

And that gave me confidence.

## What I’ve Learned So Far

The biggest gap from school was always **hands‑on tools**. I learned the theory, the vocabulary, the conceptual frameworks - but almost zero muscle memory.

It’s like going to school for carpentry, studying every type of hammer ever made, understanding the physics of striking force… and swinging one maybe twice.

So I started swinging.

Through AntiSyphon courses and independent labs, I’ve:

* Explored threat groups and their techniques through MITRE ATT&CK
* Built threat models and attacker profiles
* Used Burp Suite for the first time and practiced XSS, CSRF, SQLi, fuzzing
* Set up a working SIEM pipeline using Elastic and Jira
* Started developing intuition for detection logic and event flow
* Rebuilt foundational Linux and network skills through repetition

MITRE ATT&CK especially lit me up. Detective work is exhilarating - it reminded me why I wanted this in the first place.

## The Struggle Points

For every few steps forward, there’s still that moment where I feel overwhelmed. When something doesn’t click, an old voice shows up: *“Maybe my brain just doesn’t work like this.”* It’s awful - because I know better. My life is proof I can do impossible things with enough focus.

The biggest pain point right now? **Query languages.**
KQL, EQL, SQL - the muscle has atrophied. But realizing that gap is a bigger win than perfect performance. Now I know where to aim the practice.

## Emotional Reality: The Lowest Point

The lowest moments are when the overwhelm spikes - when the screen is full of syntax, logs, data formats, operators, flags, and I feel like I’m drowning in concepts I should “already” know. That’s when the imposter thoughts bite the hardest.

## Emotional Reality: The Turning Point

The turning point was simpler than expected: exploring MITRE ATT&CK. Just scrolling, reading, connecting dots. It felt like discovery - like detective work - and it reminded me that my brain thrives here. That was the first moment I thought: *“Maybe I really can do this.”*

## Who I Am Becoming

Right now I feel like a beginner - but in a good way. I’m realizing this field demands a perpetual beginner’s mind. It evolves too fast for mastery to ever feel complete. Maybe you don’t ever “arrive” - maybe you just adapt.

## What I Fear

Two fears stand out:

**1. The financial transition.**
My current field pays very well. I understand there may be a temporary pay cut to get into cyber, but it has to be reasonable and it has to have upward mobility. I’m not willing to sink my family for a dream.

**2. Being green again.**
It’s been a long time since I’ve been the “new guy.” I worry about walking into a place where someone half my age side‑eyes me - not knowing where I came from or what I’ve done.

## What I’m Proud Of

That I’m **showing up**.
Even when it’s hard.
Even when it’s scary.
Even when I feel behind.

Showing up is everything.

## The One Kick I Want to Master First

Right now, the strongest pull - the one area I want to develop deeply - is **detection engineering fundamentals**, including:

* Query languages
* Event analysis
* Investigative logic
* Understanding how attackers move
* Building and testing detections

It feels like the perfect bridge between everything I’ve done and everything I want to become.

## Where I Go Next

For the first time in a long time, I feel movement. Not clarity - not yet - but momentum. And maybe that’s all I need for now.

One step at a time. One skill at a time. One kick, practiced 10,000 times.

And through all the fear, uncertainty, and doubt - **I’m still showing up.**
