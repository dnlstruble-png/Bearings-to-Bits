A documented journey from Industrial Reliability to Cybersecurity

For most of my life, I never expected to work in industrial maintenance, much less specialize in rotating equipment and mechanical reliability. My first real passion was music. I spent the early years of adulthood pursuing it professionally before life pushed me in other directions. Eventually, I ended up taking a job in a chemical plant, packaging product. It wasn’t glamorous, and it wasn’t part of a grand plan, but it was an opportunity. So I took it.

Inside that plant, there were two paths forward: operations or maintenance. Operations meant swinging 12-hour shifts; maintenance meant straight days and the chance to build something steady. I chose maintenance. I enrolled in night classes at the local community college, worked hard in the shop from sunrise to well after sunset, and eventually earned my way into the trades - first as a rotating equipment mechanic, then as an instrument technician, and finally as a journeyman.

I was good at it. I learned fast. I enjoyed fixing things that most people considered unfixable. But I also felt myself hitting a ceiling. I hadn’t chosen that path - it had chosen me. In 2017, after nearly a decade in the field, I decided I wanted to pursue something I *did* choose.

That decision led me to cybersecurity.

I'm the guy who didn’t really touch a computer until I was practically an adult. My upbringing didn’t include technology. No one in my orbit worked in IT. But for some reason, cybersecurity sparked intrigue in me. It seemed alive... constantly changing. A kind of digital jiu-jitsu, where opposing sides are always inventing new techniques, passing each other’s defenses, countering counters, endlessly adapting. That energy drew me in.

To get into the bachelor’s program at WGU, I needed an entry-level credential. I studied intensely for a month, earned my CompTIA A+ certification, and was accepted. From that point on, I doubled down on learning. I completed my degree in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance while working full-time.

In the middle of all this, I was offered a position as a Mechanical Reliability Analyst. It was a turning point. I had to teach myself vibration analysis, thermography, gear-mesh calculation, failure mode analysis—everything. It woke up the problem-solver in me. I found I loved diagnosing root causes more than simply repairing consequences.

But even as I excelled in reliability, I never forgot the commitment I made to myself:  
**the next time I changed roles, it would be into cybersecurity.**

Now I’m in the transition phase - closing one chapter while opening another.

And I’ll be honest: imposter syndrome is real. Not because I lack ability, but because cybersecurity is unbelievably wide. When you’re not yet in the field, it’s hard to know what parts matter most. You don’t know what you don’t know, and figuring that out can feel like a job in itself.

Still, every day I chip away at that uncertainty. I learn, I break things, I fix mistakes, I revisit fundamentals, and I build mental maps one concept at a time. I’ve done this in every field I’ve ever entered - music, maintenance, machining, instrumentation, reliability - and I’ll do it here too.

This repository is where I document the journey:
- what I’m learning  
- how I’m learning it  
- what confuses me  
- what eventually clicks  
- and the path from the mechanical world into the digital one

This isn’t a highlight reel.  
It’s a record of growth, persistence, and choosing a future intentionally - not accidentally.

Welcome to my transition from bearings to bits.
