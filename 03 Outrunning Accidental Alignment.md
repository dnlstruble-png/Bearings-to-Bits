## **Outrunning Accidental Alignment**  
*Setting a destination before the GPS sends me into a lake.*

Reaching out to companies for the first time felt more terrifying than it probably should have. I went into it expecting complete rejection, like the universe was going to hold up a giant sign that said, “Nice try, buddy, go back to mechanical stuff.” A part of me was convinced I’d wasted my time and money getting a cybersecurity degree, and that everyone would immediately see through it, shake their heads, and ignore me. But surprisingly, that’s not what happened. Huge, impressive companies actually wrote back, and instead of telling me to buzz off, they offered help, advice, and encouragement. I’m not saying I suddenly trust the process like some wide-eyed optimist, but apparently the world outside my cynical predictions isn’t as cruel as advertised. It’s complicated progress, but progress still counts.

### **Choosing by Interest, Not Convenience**

At first, I thought the only way I could break into cybersecurity was through the OT and industrial controls route. It made sense on paper. I’ve spent years in industrial maintenance and around critical systems, and I figured that background would be the only reason anyone might let me in. The problem is, that wasn’t actually what I wanted. I would still gladly take the right opportunity if it showed up, but I don’t want to build my whole career on fear and convenience. This transition is my chance to choose where I’m going, and I don’t want to shortchange myself before I even begin.

### **Finding Direction (and Mild Panic)**

The hardest part of getting into cybersecurity is picking a direction. It feels like someone threw fifteen million career paths into a blender and told me to drink it. Every time I look at job boards or course catalogs, it’s like a mild case of sleep paralysis. I freeze there, staring at all these options while my brain conjures up a tall, rain-scented shadow at the foot of the bed whispering, “Good luck, genius.” The only thing that keeps me calm is the fact that one path actually makes sense to me: Threat Intelligence and OSINT. There’s something about digging, analyzing patterns, and trying to understand how people think that hits the same nerve that has always kept me curious in every other part of my life. Instead of staring at every possible path and feeling like I might explode, now I’m just mildly nauseous. I’ll take that as progress.

### **Hungry to Learn, Not Looking for a Shortcut**

Even with that direction, I still feel like a fish flopping on the bottom of a boat most days. I don’t know the landscape yet, and some of the terminology feels like someone dumped Scrabble tiles across the industry and told everyone to pretend they make sense. But even in the confusion, there’s a strange kind of clarity. I don’t need to know everything right now. I just need a path worth chasing, and once I have that, I can grind. I’ll take courses, do late-night research, trade hobbies for study time, and put in whatever effort it takes to catch up. I don’t want a shortcut. I don’t want special treatment. I just want a fair shot to prove it.

### **A Skill I Didn’t Realize I Already Had**

The more I think about it, the more I realize I’m not actually starting from zero, even if it feels that way at times. I’ve spent years diagnosing problems in machines where I can’t see anything directly. If a pump or gearbox is failing, the first step isn’t grabbing a tool, it’s building a mental picture of what’s happening inside where no one can look. I visualize the internals, the load paths, the stress points, the pressure changes. Then I zoom out and look at the surrounding systems — flow, temperature, structure, vibration, human behavior, even the weather. I line up invisible variables, look for patterns, and wait until the whole situation clicks into place.

People around me sometimes treat that like it’s a superpower, but I don’t really see myself that way. I just do what makes sense and follow the signals. Still, it solves problems that most people don’t even notice are developing, and I can’t deny that it works. When I think about Threat Intelligence through that lens, it doesn’t feel unfamiliar. Instead of failed bearings, it’s malicious infrastructure. Instead of tracking vibration patterns, it’s behavioral motive. Different systems, same hidden signals. If anything, it feels like I’ve already been practicing how to see what isn’t visible yet, even if I don’t always give myself credit for it.

### **Coffee With the Career Demon**

I used to think I had to beat the fear to make progress in cybersecurity. Now I’m starting to think it is more like that strange shadow from my sleep paralysis years ago. Tall, awkward, too many limbs to make anatomical sense, smelling faintly like rain, just standing there while I panic. So instead of fighting it, maybe I’ll just let it sit beside me while I learn, like we both wandered into the same coffee shop by mistake. I’ll order something strong, it can drip its vague dread all over the floor, and I’ll study anyway. It can whisper its dramatic predictions of failure, and I’ll sip my drink like, “Yeah, maybe. We’ll see.” If I’m going to carry this thing with me into a new career, I might as well ignore its theatrics and let it watch me work. Chances are, he might even have some solid insight at times.
